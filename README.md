# climate_viz

In this project, temperature data from NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies is being used to visualize climate change.

The project is based on Riffomonas Code Club where Pat Schloss (professor in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Michigan School of Medicine) teaches us curious soles how to program and analyze data better.

Many thanks to Pat!
