# climate_viz

In this project temperature data from NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies was used to visualize climate change. 

The project is based on Riffomonas Code Club, in which Pat Schloss (professor in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Michigan School of Medicine) teaches us curious souls to program and analyze data better.

Many thanks to Pat! If you want to check out Riffomonas Code Club follow this [link](https://riffomonas.org/code_club/).
